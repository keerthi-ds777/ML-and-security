## Project Overview
The project aims to classify cybersecurity incidents into different grades using machine learning models. The dataset used is `GUIDE_Test.csv`, which contains various features related to cybersecurity incidents. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Bagging Classifier.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the code:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `imblearn`

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imblearn
